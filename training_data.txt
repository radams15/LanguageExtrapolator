Cheval Fromage!
Wow! Fromage Made From Chevals?
Features
There’s a world to discover with our great features.
Tasty!
The fromage is nice, with a hint of lavender, and a touch of chilli salt.
Stinky!
They literally smell of rotten corpses, with a touch of friendship.
Easy to use
Just heat up at 180 degrees in the oven for 20 minutes, or boil in melted lard, and you'll have a tasty treat in no time!
Big
At size 8.5, our Cheval fromages are the largest in the country, with just a touch of acidity.
Jambon Free!
At cheval fromage, we do not endorse or have any Jambons in the area. They are starved and hungry when they are left out of fun, yet stop abusing the chevals.
 
 
“I have tried other products that worked fine, but this one is certainly the best of them all. It brings efficiency to a new level of simplicity.”
Jane Faber, New York
 
 
“If you are looking for a high quality cheese, I highly recommend this one. It is the very best in the field, no compromise.”
John Smith, Jersey City
 
 
“The first time I tried this cheese, I was hooked. Everything was so fabulous, modern and easy. I’ll never go back to working with any other.”
Madelaine Taylor, Paris
